   "description": "The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer, combined with QIAstat-Dx assay cartridges, uses real-time PCR to detect pathogen nucleic acids in human biological samples.  The QIAstat-Dx Analyzer and cartridges are designed as a closed system that enables hands-off sample preparation followed by detection and identification of pathogen nucleic acids. Samples are inserted into a QIAstat-Dx cartridge, which contains all the reagents to isolate and amplify nucleic acids from the sample. Detected real-time amplification signals are interpreted by the integrated software and are reported via an intuitive user interface."
